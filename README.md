# Agda code to accompany the paper "Decomposing the Univalence Axiom"

The code in [decomposing-ua](decomposing-ua/src/) formalises the arguments made in the earlier sections of the paper about decomposing the univalence axiom into other axioms. The main entry point is [Decomp.agda](decomposing-ua/src/Decomp.agda).

The code in [cubical-topos-decomp](cubical-topos-decomp/src/) formalises the constructions performed in the internal language of the subical sets topos in order to verify the new axioms. The main entry point is [root.agda](cubical-topos-decomp/src/root.agda).
